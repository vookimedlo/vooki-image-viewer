/* Image sizes in HEVC: since HEVC does not allow for odd image dimensions when
   using chroma 4:2:0, our strategy is as follows.

   - Images with odd dimensions are extended with an extra row/column which
     contains a copy of the border.
   - The HEVC image size generated by x265 is rounded up to the CTU size (?)
     and the conformance window has to be respected.
   - We add an additional crop transform to remove the extra row/column.
