# VookiImageViewer
Lightweight image viewer for a fast image preview. It has been developed to have the same viewer available for all major operating systems - Microsoft Windows 10, MacOS and GNU/Linux.

The main goal is to have free of charge cross-platform viewer with a simple design and minimum functions which are commonly used.

- Transformations
  - Rotation (90 degrees left, 90 degrees right).
  - Flip (horizontal, vertical).
  - Zoom (in, out, original size, fit to window).
- Fullscreen or Window mode.
- Remembers recent files.
- Supports Apple high definition trackpad gestures.

Supported image formats covers the very common formats as well as the rare ones. Viewer is not intentionally demosaicing the RAW images, but only displays the embedded thumbnail.
