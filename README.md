# VookiImageViewer
Lightweight image viewer for a fast image preview. It has been developed to have the same viewer available for all major operating systems - Microsoft Windows 10, MacOS and GNU/Linux.

The main goal is to have free of charge cross-platform viewer with a simple design and minimum functions which are commonly used.

- Transformations
  - Rotation _(clockwise and counterclockwise in 90Â° steps)._
  - Flip _(horizontal, vertical)._
  - Zoom _(in, out, original size, fit to window)._
- Fullscreen or Window mode.
- Remembers recent files.
- Supports Apple high definition trackpad gestures.
- Custom background color
- Custom image border color

Supported image formats covers the very common formats as well as the rare ones. Viewer is not intentionally [demosaicing][1] the RAW images, but only displays the embedded thumbnail.
