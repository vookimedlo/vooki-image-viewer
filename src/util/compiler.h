 * $5.2.9/6 Static cast
 *   Any expression can be explicitly converted to type cv void, in which case it becomes a discarded - value
 *   expression(Clause 5).[Note:however, if the value is in a temporary object(12.2), the destructor for that
 *   object is not executed until the usual time, and the value of the object is preserved for the purpose of
 *   executing the destructor.
